The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator 
that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), 
then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy 
followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute 
if the condition is falsy. 
This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the if statement.


var idade = 71;

idade >= 18 && idade <=70 ? console.log("pode") : console.log("NÃ£o Pode")

//expected output: NÃ£o Pode
